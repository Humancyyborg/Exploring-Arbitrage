This documentation outlines the mathematical approach for leveraging flash loans for price manipulation and arbitrage opportunities in Uniswap V2 pools.

Slippage Threshold
Liquidity of the Pool: L_pool
Amount of Token A to be borrowed: Δx
Resulting change in Token B after swap: Δy
Slippage Formula: Price Impact = Δy / (x + Δx)
Slippage Threshold: Price Impact Threshold = Δx / (x + Δx) > ε (e.g., 1% or 5%)
Pseudocode
def calculate_slippage_threshold(L_pool, Δx, x):
    Δy = calculate_Δy(L_pool, Δx, x)
    price_impact = Δy / (x + Δx)
    return price_impact > ε

Profit Function
Arbitrage Price Difference: P_target - P_manipulated
Amount of Arbitraged Token: Δx
Flash Loan Fee: f_loan * Δx
Gas Fees: G
Profit Function: Profit = (Arbitrage Price Difference) * (Amount of Arbitraged Token) - Flash Loan Fee - Gas Fees
Pseudocode
def calculate_optimal_amount_to_swap(L_pool, Δx, x, P_target, P_manipulated, f_loan, G):
    arbitrage_price_difference = P_target - P_manipulated
    profit = (arbitrage_price_difference * Δx) - (f_loan * Δx) - G
    return Δx

Price Shift Due to Flash Loan
New Price of Token B: (y + Δy) / (x - Δx)
Arbitrage Profit: (New Price of Token B from Arbitrage Pool - Price in Target Pool) * Amount of Token B
Pseudocode
def calculate_expected_profit(L_pool, Δx, x, y, Δy, P_target, P_manipulated):
    new_price_token_b = (y + Δy) / (x - Δx)
    arbitrage_profit = (new_price_token_b - P_target) * Δy
    return arbitrage_profit
